# Project resilience
Australians are some of the most resilient people on Earth. Having gone through difficult socio,economic disasters we have still made it and prospered with it. But everyone has a different coping mechanism to deal financial, mental and physical stress.
Project Resilience makes an effort to uncover how can we bounce back together from our hardships and be back on tracks - Stronger than ever ! After all we all are proud Australians
